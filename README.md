The design brief was to create a prototype landing page for a fictional travel website, based on mockups provided by the UI designer. The site was embedded using HTML & CSS only, and this coding will provide the framework for the remainder of the website.

-------------Features---------------

- Input field search can be edited by the user, however, at this stage, the search button will not be functional.
- Each accommodation or activity card must be clickable, but the links will be empty.
- The filters will not be functional for this version, however, they must be changed appearance on hover.
- In the menu, the “Accommodation” and “Activities” links are anchors that must lead to the appropriate sections of the page.

-------------Technical constraints---------------

- Two models provided: desktop and mobile. The site should also be adapted for tablets - customise as you wish.
- Breakpoints of +992px for desktops, +768px for tablets and below for mobiles.
- Icons from the Font Awesome library.
- The colors to be used: blue #0065FC, light blue #DEEBFF, and grey #F2F2F2.
- The main font is Raleway.
- Pixels/percentages are the preferred solution, as well as Flexbox.
